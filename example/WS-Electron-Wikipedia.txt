Electron (formerly	known as Atom	Shell) is an	open-source framework
developed	by
GitHub. It	allows for
the
development of desktop	GUI	applications using
the	Node.js runtime and	the Chromium	web
browser, originally	used for
the
development of backend	web	applications. Electron
is	the main framework	behind two	notable
open-source source	code	editors: GitHub's
Atom,
and Microsoft's	Visual Studio
Code.	
A basic	Electron app
consists of
three files: package.json	(metadata), main.js	(code)
and index.html	(graphical	user interface).
The	framework is	provided by
the Electron
executable file	(electron.exe in
Windows, electron.app on OS	X	and electron
on Linux). Developers	wishing to
add branding
and custom	icon	can rename
and/or
edit the Electron	executable file.
